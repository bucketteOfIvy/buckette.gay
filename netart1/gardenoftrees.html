        Eastern Sycamore (<i>Platanus occidentalis</i>), also known as American Sycamore, is a large, water enjoying tree native to the eastern United States that can grow to an impressive 75-100 feet of height. The tree is not only large of height, but also features large (potentially hand sized or larger), alternate, simple star shaped leaves with three larger points and a margin that is typically coarsely serrated but rarely smooth. The tree fruits pointy brown balls that consist of numerous achenes (small seed pods). These seed balls can float on water, which (when combined with the trees love for water) can lead to interesting observations when visiting streams bordered by Eastern Sycamore. The trees most distinctive feature, however, is its bark. The older and typically lower bark of the tree is tough, brownish grayish and scaled, while the younger and typically higher growth bark is thin, smooth, pale — almost white — and at the interface with older bark, freckled with scales.

          "Why this alignment??"
        </b>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The good moral alignment for Eastern Sycamore comes partially from author bias — ze loves this tree — but also due to the trees utility as a shade tree. Thanks to its large leaves, great height, and love of water, Eastern Sycamore is well-suited to grow along streams and rivers, providing precious shade that maintains their dissolved oxygen content even during the warmer summertime. Eastern Sycamore's chaotic ranking originates largely from its growing pattern. Eastern Sycamore is at least willing and at times seemingly happy to grow thick, heavy branches at a perpendicular angle to the tree itself, leading to an almost gravity defying appearance of the tree. This, coupled with its shaggy bark coloration and overall large size, leads to a tree that tends to appear rather chaotic from a distance.

        <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, frequently referred to as the maidenhair tree or simply ginkgo, is a deciduous tree native to Southeastern Asia, including but not limited to portions of China, Japan, and South Korea's Jeju Island. The tree is a favorite among a wide variety of groups. Geologists and tree-nerds hail its prehistoric origins — fossils from the genus Gingko have been found and dated back to at least 150 million years ago — while urban planners appreciate the trees shading ability — it is one of the most common street trees within the United States and beyond — and a variety of individuals hail its medicinal properties as a dietary supplement — although, as Wikipedia puts it, "there is no scientific evidence that it supports human health or is effective against any disease." The smaller category of individuals who have the time to and find enjoyment from watching trees drop their leaves also appreciate the tree, as it has been known to drop nearly all of its leaves for winter within 24 hours of starting.

      <p>
        Thanks to its over 100 million year history, the tree clearly qualifies as a lawful tree. However, the moral alignment is much more challenging. In terms of good alignment, the tree is favored as a street tree for a reason: it is extremely aesthetically appealing. The leaves, for instance, are extremely unusual among trees, with the veins radiating outwards to form the leaf instead of merging and splitting to form a stereotypical network. The overall leaf shape is also frequently symmetrical, adding to the appeal. However, the tree also has the potential to be quite a prankster. Although ginkgo's fruit is widely desired for use in tea, food, and dietary supplements, the fruit from the tree have a habit of decomposing quickly and forming a nasty, slippery pile of juice underneath the tree. As Jim Bock, the Vice President and Dean of Admissions at Swarthmore College discovered during his time as an undergraduate, slipping on this juice pile can be an unfortunate mistake, leading to ones clothes smelling disgusting and being incredibly annoying to clean for some period of time after. The fruit problem is so annoying that BBC News found themselves <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-34505628"> reporting on Seoul's 2015 discussion </a> about how to handle the prankster tree. With this mix of benefit and pranking, the tree seemingly earns a neutral moral categorization.

        Tree-of-Heaven (<i>Ailanthus altissima</i>) is an deciduous tree native to China and Taiwan that is extremely invasive within the United States. The tree is considered noxious, likely due to its production of the chemical ailanthone, which it uses to inhabit the growth of surrounding flora. Tree-of-Heaven features alternate feather-compounding leaves. It has multiple tells for identification, including two pores along the base of its leaflets, large triangular leaf scars, and less-than-appetizing smell evoked upon breaking its twigs. For interested Hyde Park-located treewatchers, one Tree-of-Heaven is present near Botany Pond.

      </h2>
      <p>
        <i>Ailanthus altissima</i>, as noted above, is invasive, but this is perhaps an understatement, as the tree is willing to grow practically anywhere. Essentially any disturbed environment with sufficient lighting within its spread is within the trees potential ecological niche, and one has even been sighted growing successfully in a crack between a building and a cement train platform. The tree is also notoriously difficult to remove; upon being cut down, the tree usually responds by growing numerous new shoots, occassionally at a distance of up to 50 feet away. Seeing as the tree is willing to grow anywhere, it is quite chaotic. The evilness of the tree's alignment comes from its rude response to removal attempts and production of ailanthone.
